  issues with Jai / SDL / OpenGL.

- Check repl.jai for an example from someone in the Discord about how to keep the metaprogram running and just restart the msgloop
  after adding new strings to the program.
  We could use a similar method to have a single background process that continuously gets the AST from the frontend, compiles it
  and sends the updated AST back. May or may not be a good idea, but I guess it's worth a try..
